      products, services, or conduct; and (4) your review must otherwise comply

      of the interpretation or performance of this Agreement, or that in any way
      relate to your use of the Sites, the Materials, and/or other content on
      the Sites, shall be submitted exclusively to binding arbitration, except

      Arbitration means that an arbitrator and not a judge or jury will decide

      documents you and ManagerSpecial submit to the arbitrator, unless you
      request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is
      necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be
      determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will
      have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the
      parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</span

      types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The
      arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the
      claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide the relief warranted

      relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought
