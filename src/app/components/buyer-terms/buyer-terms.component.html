  <p>
    Whether or not you obtain the credits in your account via your personal
    credit card purchase or any grant or gift by ManangerSpecial, the credits in
    your account cannot be refunded in cash for any reason. When you purchase

  </p>
  <h2>Our Business (Serving Restaurants and Many other Retailers)</h2>
  <p>
    Manager Special connects hungry diners with local restaurants. You may order
    food through our site from many restaurants or other purveyors of food or
    service in cities throughout the United States and other territories where
    ManagerSpecial provides such services.
  </p>
  <p>
    ManagerSpecial is not a restaurant, or food preparation entity. The
    restaurants, Services and other food purveyors available on our Sites
    (collectively, the “restaurants”) operate independently of ManagerSpecial.
    The restaurants are required to comply with federal, state, and local laws,
    rules, regulations, and standards pertaining to the preparation, sale, and
    marketing of food, including, without limitation, food preparation and
    safety and menu disclosure. ManagerSpecial is not liable or responsible for
    the restaurants' food preparation or safety and does not verify their
    compliance with all applicable laws. In addition, ManagerSpecial does not
    guarantee the quality of what the restaurants or other food purveyors sell,
    nor does it guarantee the services provided by them, including, without
    limitation, in those cases where they provide the delivery services or
    engage another third party delivery service. ManagerSpecial does not
    independently verify, and is not liable for, representations made by
    restaurants regarding their food, including, without limitation, any menu-
    or restaurant-level descriptors or disclosures.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Sites may permit you to make purchases without an Account or without
    logging in to your Account. If you make a purchase in this manner, we may
    create an Account for you based on the information provide to us in
    connection with the transaction (e.g., your name, phone number, email
    address, and other transaction information). If you are a minor in the
    jurisdiction in which you reside (generally under the age of 18), you must
    have the permission of, and be directly supervised by, your parent or legal
    guardian to use the Sites, and your parent or legal guardian must read and
    agree to this Agreement prior to your using the Sites. Notwithstanding the
    foregoing, you are not authorized to use the Sites if you are under the age
    of 13. If you are using the Sites on behalf of an entity, organization, or
    company, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that
    organization to this Agreement and you agree to be bound by this Agreement
    on behalf of that organization.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may only create and hold one account on each Site for your personal use
    (an “Account”). You may have another account if you are using the Site as
    part of a corporate account created for business purposes pursuant to a
    separate agreement with ManagerSpecial. In consideration of the use of the
    Sites and the services contained therein, you agree that you are able to
    create a binding legal obligation with ManagerSpecial, and you also agree
    to: (a) provide true, accurate, current, and complete information about
    yourself, and (b) maintain and promptly update the personal information you
    provide to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete.

    have the permission of, and be directly supervised by, your parent or legal
    guardian to use the Sites, and your parent or legal guardian must read and

  </p>
  <p>
    If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or
    incomplete, including, without limitation, having an invalid or expired
    payment method on file, or if ManagerSpecial has reasonable grounds to
    suspect that any information you provide is untrue, inaccurate, not current
    or incomplete, ManagerSpecial has the right to block your current or future
    use of the Sites (or any portion thereof) and/or terminate this Agreement
    with you. If your Account is cancelled for any or no reason, you may forfeit
    any pending, current, or future account credits or promotional offers and
    any other forms of unredeemed value in or associated with your Account
    without prior notice to you.

    Account including your password and, if applicable, any password for
    Facebook, Google, or other third party login. You are also responsible for

        The Sites and other Interactive Areas may allow you to rate (“Ratings”)
        and post reviews (“Reviews”) of restaurants and other businesses. Such
        Ratings and Reviews are considered User Content and are governed by the
        terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, without limitation,
        your agreement regarding your use of Interactive Areas and the Sites'
        standards of conduct. Ratings and Reviews are not endorsed by
        ManagerSpecial, and do not represent the views of ManagerSpecial or of
        any affiliate or partner of ManagerSpecial. ManagerSpecial does not
        assume liability for Ratings and Reviews or for any claims, liabilities,
        or losses resulting from any Ratings and Reviews. We strive to maintain
        a high level of integrity with our Ratings and Reviews and other User
        Content. Therefore, all Ratings and Reviews must comply with the
        following criteria: (1) before posting a Rating or Review, you must have
        had first-hand experience with the restaurant within the 7-day period
        prior to your review; (2) you may not have a proprietary or other
        affiliation with either the restaurant or any of its competitors; (3)
        you may not draw any legal conclusions regarding the restaurants'
        products, services, or conduct; and (4) your review must otherwise
        comply with the terms of this Agreement. Any Rating and/or Review that
        we determine, in our sole discretion, could diminish the integrity of
        the Ratings and Reviews, the Materials and/or the Sites may be removed
        or excluded by us without notice.

    ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR MOBILE APPLICATIONS
  </h2>
  <p>
    We may make available software to access ManagerSpecial’s websites,
    technology platforms, and related online and mobile services via a mobile
    device (“Mobile Applications”). To use any Mobile Application, you must use
    a mobile device that is compatible with that Mobile Application.
    ManagerSpecial does not warrant that any Mobile Application will be
    compatible with your mobile device. You may use mobile data in connection
    with the Mobile Applications and may incur additional charges from your
    wireless provider for these services. You agree that you are solely
    responsible for any such charges. ManagerSpecial hereby grants you a
    non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use a compiled code
    copy of the Mobile Applications for one Account on a mobile device owned or
    leased solely by you, for your personal use. You acknowledge that
    ManagerSpecial may from time to time issue upgraded versions of the Mobile
    Applications, and may automatically electronically upgrade the version of
    any Mobile Applications that you are using on your mobile device. You
    consent to such automatic upgrading on your mobile device and agree to
    timely upgrade the Mobile Application in the event there is no automatic
    update. You further agree that the terms and conditions of this Agreement
    will apply to all upgrades to the Mobile Applications. Any third party code
    that may be incorporated in the Mobile Applications is covered by the
    applicable open source or third party license EULA, if any, authorizing use
    of such code. The foregoing license grant is not a sale of the Mobile
    Applications or any copy thereof, and ManagerSpecial or its third party
    partners or suppliers retain all right, title, and interest in the Mobile
    Applications (and any copy thereof). Any attempt by you to transfer any of
    the rights, duties, or obligations hereunder, except as expressly provided
    for in this Agreement, is void. ManagerSpecial reserves all rights not
    expressly granted under this Agreement with respect to the Mobile
    Applications and otherwise. If any Mobile Application is being acquired on
    behalf of the United States Government, then the following provision
    applies: The Mobile Application will be deemed to be “commercial computer
    software” and “commercial computer software documentation,” respectively,
    pursuant to DFAR § 227.7202 and FAR § 12.212, as applicable. Any use,
    reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of the Sites and
    any accompanying documentation by the U.S. Government will be governed
    solely by this Agreement and is prohibited except to the extent expressly
    permitted by this Agreement. The Mobile Applications originate in the United
    States, and are subject to United States export laws and regulations. The
    Mobile Applications may not be exported or re-exported to certain countries
    or those persons or entities prohibited from receiving exports from the
    United States. In addition, the Mobile Applications may be subject to the
    import and export laws of other countries. You agree to comply with all
    United States and foreign laws related to use of the Mobile Applications and
    the Sites.
  </p>

    The following applies to any Mobile Application you acquire from the Apple
    App Store (“Apple-Sourced Software”): You acknowledge and agree that this
    Agreement is solely between you and ManagerSpecial, not Apple, Inc.
    (“Apple”) and that Apple has no responsibility for the Apple-Sourced
    Software or content thereof. Your use of the Apple-Sourced Software must
    comply with the App Store Terms of Service. You acknowledge that Apple has
    no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services
    with respect to the Apple-Sourced Software. In the event of any failure of
    the Apple-Sourced Software to conform to any applicable warranty, you may
    notify Apple, and Apple will refund to you the purchase price for the
    Apple-Sourced Software; to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law,
    Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the
    Apple-Sourced Software, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
    costs, or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty
    will be solely governed by this Agreement and any law applicable to
    ManagerSpecial as provider of the software. You acknowledge that Apple is
    not responsible for addressing any of your claims or those of any third
    party relating to the Apple-Sourced Software or your possession and/or use
    of the Apple-Sourced Software, including, but not limited to: (i) product
    liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Apple-Sourced Software fails to
    conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims
    arising under consumer protection or similar legislation; and all such
    claims are governed solely by this Agreement and any law applicable to
    ManagerSpecial as provider of the software. You acknowledge that, in the
    event of any third-party claim that the Apple-Sourced Software or your
    possession and use of that Apple-Sourced Software infringes that third
    party’s intellectual property rights, ManagerSpecial, not Apple, will be
    solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge
    of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required
    by this Agreement. You and ManagerSpecial acknowledge and agree that Apple,
    and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of this Agreement as
    it relates to your license of the Apple-Sourced Software, and that, upon
    your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Apple will
    have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce
    this Agreement against you as a third-party beneficiary as it relates to
    your license of the Apple-Sourced Software .

    The following applies to any Mobile Applications you acquire from the Google

    Google’s then-current Google Play Store Terms of Service; (iii) Google is
    only a provider of the Google Play Store where you obtained the
    Google-Sourced Software; (iv) ManagerSpecial, and not Google, is solely
    responsible for its Google-Sourced Software; (v) Google has no obligation or
    liability to you with respect to Google-Sourced Software or the Agreement;
    and (vi) you acknowledge and agree that Google is a third-party beneficiary
    to the Agreement as it relates to ManagerSpecial’s Google-Sourced Software.

      trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.
      Arbitration means that an arbitrator and not a judge or jury will decide
      the claim. Rights to prehearing exchange of information and appeals may
      also be limited in arbitration. You acknowledge and agree that you and
      ManagerSpecial are each waiving the right to a trial by jury. You further
      acknowledge and agree that you waive your right to participate as a
      plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative
      proceeding. Further, unless both you and ManagerSpecial otherwise agree in
      writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims,
      and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative
      proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the
      entirety of this "Dispute Resolution" section will be deemed void. Except
      as provided in the preceding sentence, this "Dispute Resolution" section
      will survive any termination of these Terms of Use. You further
      acknowledge that any claim arising under this Agreement must be brought
      within one year of its accrual or it will be waived.
    </p>
    <li>Arbitration Rules</li>
    <p>
      The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration
      Association ("AAA") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules
      and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the "AAA
      Rules") then in effect, except as modified by this "Dispute Resolution"
      section. (The AAA Rules are available at
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.adr.org/Rules">Rules</a>
      or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879). The Federal Arbitration Act will
      govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section.
    </p>
    <li>Arbitration Process</li>
    <div>
      A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party
      with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The
      AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at

        >Demand for Arbitration Consumer Arbitration Rules</a

              s%20Notice%20California%20Consumers.pdf"
        >AA Affidavit for Waiver of Fees Notice California Consumers</a
      >.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed
      to practice law in the county in which you reside and will be selected by
      the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the
      parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of
      delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the
      arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.
    </div>
    <li>
      Arbitration Location and Procedure
    </li>
    <p>
      Unless you and ManagerSpecial otherwise agree, the arbitration will be
      conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed
      $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of
      documents you and ManagerSpecial submit to the arbitrator, unless you
      request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is
      necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be
      determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will
      have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the
      parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
    </p>
    <li>Arbitrator's Decision</li>
    <p>
      The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the
      AAA Rules. The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings
      and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the
      arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
      The arbitrator's award damages must be consistent with the terms of the
      "Limitation of Liability" section above as to the types and the amounts of
      damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award
      declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to
      the extent necessary to provide the relief warranted by the claimant's
      individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration, you will be entitled to
      an award of attorneys' fees and expenses to the extent provided under
      applicable law. ManagerSpecial will not seek, and hereby waives, all
      rights ManagerSpecial may have under applicable law to recover attorneys'
      fees and expenses if ManagerSpecial prevails in arbitration.
    </p>
    <li>Fees</li>
    <p>
      Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator
      fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim
      for damages does not exceed $5,000, ManagerSpecial will pay all such fees
      unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the
      relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought
      for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal
      Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
    </p>
    <li>Changes</li>
    <p>
      ManagerSpecial reserves the right to change this "Dispute Resolution"
      section, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before
      the effective date of such amendment. Notwithstanding the provisions of
      the modification-related provisions above, if ManagerSpecial changes this
      "Dispute Resolution" section after the date you first accepted this
      Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement), you
      agree that your continued use of the Sites after such change will be
      deemed acceptance of those changes. If you do not agree to such change,
      you may reject any such change by providing ManagerSpecial written notice
      of such rejection by mail or hand delivery to: ManagerSpecial, Attn:

        target="_blank"
        href="mailto: disputeresolution@ManagerSpecial.com"
        >disputeresolution@ManagerSpecial.com</a
      >, within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated
      in the "Effective" date above. In order to be effective, the notice must
      include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to reject changes
      to this "Dispute Resolution" section. By rejecting changes, you are
      agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between you and
      ManagerSpecial in accordance with the provisions of this "Dispute
      Resolution" section as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or
      accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement, as applicable).
